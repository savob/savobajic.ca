alternating magnetic fields generated from four pairs of magnetic tweezers.
- Conducted literature review on magneto-thermal relationships of iron nano-particles to guide in design
decision making.
- Created multiple models in COMSOL Multi-Physics to predict electro-magneto-thermo-relationships used to
forecast efficacy of treatments and sensitivity of the system.
- Improved magnetic field generator design to increase survey-able workspace by 50%
