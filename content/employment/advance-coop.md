draft: false
period: "May 2018 - August 2018"
company: "IGB Automotive"
summary: "Focused on developing novel quality assurance testing schemes for an automotive component supplier."
points: ["Integrated a force regulation system into legacy robotic arm systems for use in seat durability testing. This system was an expanded version of my previous work going from regulating a single axis of force to six, so a controlled path can be followed adapting to regulate force and torque at each point.", "A PLC to computer interface was created using a National Instruments data acquisition unit that was operated using a LabVIEW program on the computer.", "Emulated a serial communication protocol between the robot PLC and computer using software to communicate status and instructions to and from the robot.", "Trained technicians to operate and configure the durability testing system, allowing tests to be tailored to the needs of specific clients.", "Prepared technical documents detailing system operation catered to different levels of users for the system.", "Contributed code to improve the flexibility of our end of line product testers so they could be easily reconfigured for new clients and products."]

*Small note: the actual title of this position was "Advance Co-op" since I worked for the "Advance" department which was responsible to "advance" our technologies. However, I have listed it as "Advance**d**" since everyone seems to think of it as a spelling mistake at first glance.*

- Integrated a force regulation system into legacy robotic arm systems for use in seat durability testing. 
This system was an expanded version of my previous work going from regulating a single axis of force to six, so a controlled path can be followed adapting to regulate force and torque at each point.
- A PLC to computer interface was created using a National Instruments data acquisition unit that was operated using a LabVIEW program on the computer.
- Emulated a serial communication protocol between the robot PLC and computer using software to communicate status and instructions to and from the robot.
- Trained technicians to operate and configure the durability testing system, allowing tests to be tailored to the needs of specific clients.
- Prepared technical documents detailing system operation catered to different levels of users for the system.
- Contributed code to improve the flexibility of our end of line product testers so they could be easily reconfigured for new clients and products.
