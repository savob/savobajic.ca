*My first job! Wheee!*

# Overview

This was my first engineering job, and served as my gateway into the electronics part of mechatronics and ultimately what became my passion for embedded electronics!

I spent the summer jumping around a series of small projects, many of them I would complete within a week or so like the [demo seat upgrade]({{< ref "projects/work/showseat" >}}), time to time I would contribute to a larger project. My crowning project during this coop term though was the [kneeload robot]({{< ref "projects/work/kneeload" >}}) which I really enjoyed every minute of.

The highlights of this job were:

- Developed and performed different material tests to determine key performance indicators to assist in design decisions such as resistance to bending fatigue, and compiled reports based on the results.
- Interfaced a legacy (1995) welding robotics system to be controlled by modern computers. System conducted durability testing on automotive seats by repeatedly applying controlled linear forces to predefined points.
- Programmed system in LabVIEW to operate the robot, calibrate the load cell, control the seat features remotely, and record testing data.
- Conducted troubleshooting and corrective maintenance on manufacturing equipment for mechanical/electrical issues to prevent extended production interruptions.
- Developed the hardware and software for a new product showcase system at industry showcases.
