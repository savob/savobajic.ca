title: "Reliability Engineering Coop"
date: 2019-07-03T01:11:58-05:00
draft: false
period: "July 2019 - August 2020"
company: "Patheon, a part of ThermoFisher Scientific"
summary: "Worked to oversee and implement new preventative and predictive maintenance programs, as well as providing other support to the engineering team"
points: ["Aided in the introduction of new equipment to the site by researching maintenance requirements and establishing formal and traceable preventative maintenance work plans and schedules", "Prepared weekly Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as unexpected downtime, number of work orders, and duration of repairs based on equipment performance for each department", "Prepared monthly KPIs including summaries of the weekly KPIs and KPIs that categorized all the equipment failures for the month. Used KPIs to submit recommendations to maintenance that decreased annual downtime by more than 20%", "Mediated inter-department disputes that arose during project delivery", "Expanded and maintained vibrational analysis predictive maintenance (PdM) program for critical assets. This led to detection and correction of five instances of early failure signs in the first three months of deployment"]

This was a different pace for me, for a few reasons. Firstly, I was leaving the automotive industry for pharmaceuticals, and secondly, although advertised as being roughly half technical, half administrative, I found my duties leaned almost entirely on administrative work by the end.

I learned a lot there in terms of managing equipment, with the highlights being:

- Aided in the introduction of new equipment to the site by researching maintenance requirements and establishing formal and traceable preventative maintenance work plans and schedules.
- Prepared weekly Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as unexpected downtime, number of work orders, and duration of repairs based on equipment performance for each department
- Prepared monthly KPIs including summaries of the weekly KPIs and KPIs that categorized all the equipment failures for the month. Used KPIs to submit recommendations to maintenance that decreased annual downtime by more than 20%.
- Mediated inter-department disputes that arose during project delivery.
- Expanded and maintained vibrational analysis predictive maintenance (PdM) program for critical assets. This led to detection and correction of five instances of early failure signs in the first three months of deployment.
