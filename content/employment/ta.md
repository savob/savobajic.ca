During my master's I was given the opportunity to be a teaching assistant (TA) for courses. I applied to, and received an offer to be a lab TA for Praxis III (ESC204) which teaches second year Engineering Science students the basics of mechatronics design and prototyping in the context of an open ended humanitarian project.
