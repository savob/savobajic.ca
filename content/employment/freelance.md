# Starting Out

It's always been a bit of a dream for me to do embedded system design as my job, and I finally got my start in it as I was wrapping my Master's studies. I've completed one project thus far, and am looking to do more, so if you're looking to hire me, check out my [contact page]({{< ref "contact" >}}) to reach out!

What I do:

- Determine the technical scope of a project based on non-technical discussion with client(s)
- Perform component selection and sourcing to optimize for cost
- Design and assemble custom circuit boards
- Program application specific code
- Test and debug custom hardware and code
- Document my code and design files so that my work can be easily maintained and developed by others
