# Starting Out

It's always been a bit of a dream for me to do embedded system design as my job, and I finally got my start in it as I was wrapping up my Master's studies. I focused on work with one client one, although I did have some one-off projects with others. All the projects were pretty varied applications for embedded systems so I enjoyed the work thoroughly.

# Services I Offered

Although I can't discuss all the work I've done thus far, I will share what I have done at a high level:

- Determine the technical scope of a project based on non-technical discussion with client(s)
- Perform component selection and sourcing to optimize for cost
- Design and assemble custom circuit boards
- Program application specific code
- Test and debug custom hardware and code
- Document my code and design files so that my work can be easily maintained and developed by others

# Projects I Did

Some of the projects I worked on that are public, here are two that really standout for me *(since I claim the lion's share of credit for their designs)*.

## Contact Sensor

My first project as a freelancer was working on making a [contact sensor]({{< ref "projects/work/loadcell.md" >}}) for Engineering Design Lab which was developing a five-axis 3D printer at the time. The purpose of this system was to allow the print head to be used as a contact probe for automatic self-calibration. I took EDL's high-level concept for the sensor and turned it into fully fleshed system in the course of several weeks as I was finishing my masters studies.

I delivered and assembled the boards into their system on time and on budget, which really felt amazing to do in a professional *(technical)* sphere! The circuit exceeeded their expectations and left a fair bit of room for further features to be added, namely additional digital protocols without modifying the hardware!

I have more details in my write up on the project [here]({{< ref "projects/work/loadcell.md" >}}) if you're interested!

## DATA Board

This was a project I undertook with a friend that I met through pure chance. He just happened to be the creative director for an artist I really liked, one of the largest reggaeton producers in the world: Tainy! The album was heavily sci-fi, and in particular cyberpunk themed visually, drawing from the classics like Neuromancer and Ghost in the Shell, which I resonated with and suggested we try to make some circuitboard art together!

The direction I decided to take was that of a PCB in the design of the album's logo, with LEDs on the perimeter to enact different effects. Currently on the first revision, but a second is planned. Write up incoming when I get to it...

# Hire Me!
