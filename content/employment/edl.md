I joined [Engineering Design Lab](https://www.engdesignlab.com/), EDL, after being a freelance consultant for them for several months. Worked there for about a year and it was been super exciting and interesting, and although I can't share all the details of my work like with my personal projects I've still got some highlights.

Much of my role aligned with what I was doing previously as a [freelancer]({{< ref "employment/freelance" >}}) for them; determining technical scopes, delivering complete systems and firmware - but with some newer roles and responsibilities added as EDL seeked to expand their capabilities in electronics, including managing some recruiting and staffing as well as liaising directly with clients.

In my time I had the pleasure to work on some external projects with clients varying from electric mobility startups to artists for public exhibits, as well as some internal projects for the government like [WAL-LE]({{< ref "projects/work/walle" >}}) and our own product I designed _electrically_ - the Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) which EDL is currently launching. I've listed some of these highlights with my [work projects]({{< ref "projects/work" >}}).
