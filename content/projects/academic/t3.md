# Overview

As part of my master's I had the opportunity to do a project for course credits, which I decided to do so I could sharpen my practical skills some more than what I would have, had I had just done courses. The project I got accepted to do was to make the circuit board that would host an experimental new coded-exposure image sensor the [Intelligent Sensory Microsystem Laboratory](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~roman/lab/index.html) (ISML) had produced.

The sensor I was going to work on was their T3.2 sensor, their newest iteration of a Time of Flight (ToF) imaging sensor to determine the distance of objects in a scene from the camera. This was to be achieved through a combination of controlled illumination, galvo mirrors, and specialized pixel design on the sensor. In addition to the hardware design of the circuit board, I was also tasked with preparing the driver code that would run on the embedded Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and allow users to get the readings from the image sensor to them be processed on a host computer.

Alongside the development of T3.2, I also aided in the development of the T7 image sensor system, the highest resolution image sensor ISML had manufactured to date. My contributions to T7 focused on improving the high-speed performance of the sensor in burst imaging and sub-frame readout applications (*explained later, trust me!*)

## Requirements

The project as initially outlined to me had three main deliverables:

- The schematic and PCB design of a carrier board for the FPGA and T3.2 chip
- FPGA drivers to pull data off T3.2
- Improvements to PC drivers for data and driving the galvo system

Overtime this shifted a bit as did the priorities of the lab and the changing situation of T3.2 to reflect this by the end of my project. As shown, my work became more focused on the digital design of the system and moving data around:

- The schematic and PCB design of a carrier board for the FPGA and T3.2 chip
- FPGA drivers to pull data off T3.2
- Lead sub-frame readout of T7
- Improve USB transfer speeds for all systems
- Experiments on T7 for ISSCC publication

## Objectives

The primary objective of this work was to get it working with minimal changes to the existing system. This gave me some physical constraints for the the final size of the circuit board and the placement of some parts, namely the image sensor and FPGA. Outside that, I had essentially free reign on how I got things working for T3.2 although it made sense for me to make use of their existing work.

Outside of the T3.2 system, one of my main objectives was to try and get our USB data communication rates up to almost 80&nbsp;Mb/s, about an order of magnitude above the rate at the start, yet only a quarter of the advertized and verified speed possible by the FPGA of 300&nbsp;Mb/s.

## Takeaways

Ultimately I completed the design and bring up of the PCB largely by myself, based on the work done for the previous iterations leading up to T3.2. I did have the aid of some summer students I oversaw for the programming when it came to those tasks. Unfortunately when we finally inserted the chip we found that the chip failed to function as it was meant to ultimately killing my project so I pivoted to aid more in T7. In the conclusion of my report I prepared for the group, I listed a series of improvements to consider both for the future of the T3 line, as well as things I noticed would benefit all future ISML work.

I learned a lot about designing multi-layered circuit boards, imaging sensors, digital design, and what bringing up a custom chip is like - all things I am thankful to have gained. Some key points for me were:

- The importance of adding pull-up/-down resistors where needed
- Performing power and efficiency calculations are helpful when planning a circuit
- The importance of a well maintained and buffered data pipeline between FPGA and DRAM
- Timing closure importance and the odd bugs that can occur when a system fails to stay in sync

# Detailed Report

At the conclusion of the project I submitted a report, which is the basis of this write up. Some parts were heavily modified (usually extended) given this is my website, my rules. Unfortunately, since this was a project derived from and ultimately belonging to ISML, I don't have the right to lay out all the details as I would generally for the other work I post about.

# Coded Exposure Imaging

The functional basics of the cameras developed by ISML is Coded Exposure Imaging (CEI), a modern class of digital cameras. Their defining improvement over traditional digital imaging sensor is per-pixel control of exposure ("coding" or "masking" the image). This is generally done as a series of "subframes" which the resulting cumulative exposure is the frame. This enables different regions of the same sensor to capture light for different periods, which in conjunction with proper post-processing enables novel imaging techniques with applications in High Dynamic Range (HDR), medical, and control system imaging.

At ISML the CEI sensors being developed are multi-tap CEI pixels. Each pixel has multiple taps which are "exposed" based on the masking applied to the pixel array, thus masking pixels does not lead to light being lost, merely "sorted" into different taps during the exposure period. The T3 line of sensors has four-tap pixels while the T7 sensor has a two-tap pixel structure.

Augmenting these sensors with controlled illumination sources that are synchronized to the coding further enhances their utility, allowing for advanced data to be collected visually often at video rates of 30 frames per second or more. An example of this is demonstrated where a CEI sensor with controlled illumination was able to determine both the normals and albedo (reflectivity) of all the surfaces in the scene.

# Time of Flight Sensing

Time of Flight (ToF) sensing is the process of determining an object's distance by timing the duration is takes for some waves to reflect off and return with the speed of those waves known in the medium, hence *"time of flight"*. Sound is often used for this (e.g. echolocation for bats), but light can also be used with the correct sensing system.
