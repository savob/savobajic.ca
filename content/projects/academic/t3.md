# Overview

As part of my master's I had the opportunity to do a project for course credits, which I decided to do so I could sharpen my practical skills some more than what I would have, had I had just done courses. The project I got accepted to do was to make the circuit board that would host an experimental new coded-exposure image sensor the [Intelligent Sensory Microsystem Laboratory](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~roman/lab/index.html) (ISML) had produced.

The sensor I was going to work on was their T3.2 sensor, their newest iteration of a Time of Flight (ToF) imaging sensor to determine the distance of objects in a scene from the camera. This was to be achieved through a combination of controlled illumination, galvo mirrors, and specialized pixel design on the sensor. In addition to the hardware design of the circuit board, I was also tasked with preparing the driver code that would run on the embedded Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and allow users to get the readings from the image sensor to them be processed on a host computer.

Alongside the development of T3.2, I also aided in the development of the T7 image sensor system, the highest resolution image sensor ISML had manufactured to date. My contributions to T7 focused on improving the high-speed performance of the sensor in burst imaging and sub-frame readout applications (*explained later, trust me!*)

## Requirements

The project as initially outlined to me had three main deliverables:

- The schematic and PCB design of a carrier board for the FPGA and T3.2 chip
- FPGA drivers to pull data off T3.2
- Improvements to PC drivers for data and driving the galvo system

Overtime this shifted a bit as did the priorities of the lab and the changing situation of T3.2 to reflect this by the end of my project. As shown, my work became more focused on the digital design of the system and moving data around:

- The schematic and PCB design of a carrier board for the FPGA and T3.2 chip
- FPGA drivers to pull data off T3.2
- Lead sub-frame readout of T7
- Improve USB transfer speeds for all systems
- Experiments on T7 for ISSCC publication

## Objectives

The primary objective of this work was to get it working with minimal changes to the existing system. This gave me some physical constraints for the the final size of the circuit board and the placement of some parts, namely the image sensor and FPGA. Outside that, I had essentially free reign on how I got things working for T3.2 although it made sense for me to make use of their existing work.

Outside of the T3.2 system, one of my main objectives was to try and get our USB data communication rates up to almost 80&nbsp;Mb/s, about an order of magnitude above the rate at the start, yet only a quarter of the advertized and verified speed possible by the FPGA of 300&nbsp;Mb/s.

## Takeaways

Ultimately I completed the design and bring up of the PCB largely by myself, based on the work done for the previous iterations leading up to T3.2. I did have the aid of some summer students I oversaw for the programming when it came to those tasks. Unfortunately when we finally inserted the chip we found that the chip failed to function as it was meant to ultimately killing my project so I pivoted to aid more in T7. In the conclusion of my report I prepared for the group, I listed a series of improvements to consider both for the future of the T3 line, as well as things I noticed would benefit all future ISML work.

I learned a lot about designing multi-layered circuit boards, imaging sensors, digital design, and what bringing up a custom chip is like - all things I am thankful to have gained. Some key points for me were:

- The importance of adding pull-up/-down resistors where needed
- Performing power and efficiency calculations are helpful when planning a circuit
- The importance of a well maintained and buffered data pipeline between FPGA and DRAM
- Timing closure importance and the odd bugs that can occur when a system fails to stay in sync

# Detailed Report

At the conclusion of the project I submitted a report, which is the basis of this write up. Some parts were heavily modified (usually extended) given this is my website, my rules. Unfortunately, since this was a project derived from and ultimately belonging to ISML, I don't have the right to lay out all the details as I would generally for the other work I post about.

# Introduction

There are a few technical concepts that I will explain to set the stage for the rest of the report

## Coded Exposure Imaging

The functional basics of the cameras developed by ISML is Coded Exposure Imaging (CEI), a modern class of digital cameras. Their defining improvement over traditional digital imaging sensor is per-pixel control of exposure ("coding" or "masking" the image). This is generally done as a series of "subframes" which the resulting cumulative exposure is the frame. This enables different regions of the same sensor to capture light for different periods, which in conjunction with proper post-processing enables novel imaging techniques with applications in High Dynamic Range (HDR), medical, and control system imaging.

At ISML the CEI sensors being developed are multi-tap CEI pixels. Each pixel has multiple taps which are "exposed" based on the masking applied to the pixel array, thus masking pixels does not lead to light being lost, merely "sorted" into different taps during the exposure period. The T3 line of sensors has four-tap pixels while the T7 sensor has a two-tap pixel structure.

Augmenting these sensors with controlled illumination sources that are synchronized to the coding further enhances their utility, allowing for advanced data to be collected visually often at video rates of 30 frames per second or more. An example of this is demonstrated where a CEI sensor with controlled illumination was able to determine both the normals and albedo (reflectivity) of all the surfaces in the scene.

## Time of Flight Sensing

Time of Flight (ToF) sensing is the process of determining an object's distance by timing the duration is takes for some waves to reflect off an object and return to a source, hence *"time of flight"*. Sound is often used for this (e.g. echolocation for bats), but light can also be used with the correct sensing system. Light can offer a much finer resolution of depth sensing in a scene, with the trade off being a more complicated system is needed to resolve the sub-nanosecond timing for the speed of light.

The method employed by the T3.2 system is **"pulse-based"** ToF. Using four buckets which are each exposed 90 degrees out of phase with one another, one can both accurately estimate the ToF given the relative amount of exposure between these buckets, as shown below.

{{< fig src="/images/t3-tof-tap-demo.png" caption="Bucket exposure based on pulse return" >}}

Another benefit of using four buckets is that it allows for the ambient light levels to be determined on the fly and accounted for when calculating the ToF by correlating the different pairs 180 degrees apart.

## T3.2 and T7 Image Sensors

As mentioned before, T3.2 is a four tap pixel image sensor, with a resolution of 1032 by 44 pixels. It's focus was ToF imaging with the capability to do CEI. Due to it being a line sensor it is dependant on an opto-mechanical assembly including of galvo mirrors to redirect light so it may properly scan a scene from top to bottom. Due to issues with the internal Analog to Digital Convertors (ADCs) of T3 used to determine the exposure of pixels, T3.2 was designed with 18 analog outputs for external ADC to perform this duty as a contingency if the issue reoccured.

T7 is a two-tap pixel image sensor, with a resolution of 480 by 640, the highest from ISML to that point. Its primary focus is CEI, with it's large resolution it has been a good candidate for many new techniques. Since it is a more conventional "square" image sensor, it depends on a simple optical lens to properly focus the scene before it.

# Circuit Board for T3.2

The bulk of my work for my master's project was related to the design and validation of this PCB. I will try to stay high level here, leaving the details in my report. In short the PCB had to carry all the supporting electronics needed to have T3.2 operate, and then route the signals from T3.2 into the FPGA to then pass onto the host computer, below is a simple block diagram of the system.

{{< fig src="/images/t3-board-block-diagram.png" caption="Block diagram of PCB systems" >}}

There was a draft design made for T3.2 in ISML before I was brought onto the project, which was used as the basis for my design. Furthermore, improvements made to the other host boards in the lab since T3 (namely T6's and T7's) were incorporated into the design.

## Objectives and Constraints

The major change for the host board from T3 to T3.2 was the inclusion of *"off-chip"* ADCs to serve as backups in the event the ADCs in the T3.2 chip (*"on-chip"* ADCs) failed to operate. The remainder of the objectives aligned largely to the original ones for T3. Listed in no particular order, the design objectives for this were:

- The new PCB had to fit within the existing enclosure and optical system for T3
    - Location of the T3.2 sensor must fall under the current optical assembly (metallic structure in Figures of the system)
    - The board was not to interfere with the vertical support to the upper left portion of the host board location and reference camera stand on the left
    - The resulting allowed dimensions were 110&nbsp;mm wide, 170&nbsp;mm long; with the center of the T3.2 chip placed approximately 40&nbsp;mm in from both the top and right edges
- The PCB was limited to six copper layers, but could have components placed on both sides
- Handle all the FPGA-sensor connections with minimal delays and phase skew on data buses
- Host the newly introduced off-chip ADCs
- Allow for the digital adjustment of all the power lines feeding T3.2
- Allow for the insertion of external power on the power lines in the event of design failure or power monitoring is needed

## Schematic Design

The schematic for T3.2 was heavily based on what was done for T3, and the previous work ISML had done prior to me joining. Most of my contributions to the schematic design were optimizing and renovating subsystems with either improved designs from other ISML projects, or entirely novel designs for the group. *Since the work is not entirely mine, I will not be sharing the complete schematics of the T3.2 PCB like I have with my other projects.*

### Part Selection

The first task I had in January as I was onbaorded was to review the Bill of Materials, BoM, to identify if any parts in the draft design were unavailable or critically low from our preffered vendor and then replace in the design accordingly. Luckily only two minor parts were out of stock and needed replacing, both were part of the voltage reference subsystem for T3.2's on-chip ADCs. 

The replacements were sourced from the design for T7 which has similar components. One component replacement was almost like-for-like, but the other was a linear voltage regulator with a lower current rating. This decrease on allowable current was accepted by the team and I went about working on the schematic further.

### Input and Output

Given that the FPGA needed to not only communicate with T3.2 and its supporting circuits but also the off-chip ADCs, it ran out of pins to directly connect to everything. To address the input/output limitation two methods were employed: firstly for "slow" signals such as chip selects or resets a pair of input/output expander chips were added to the circuit allowing the FPGA to operate up to 32 pins with just two of its own at the expense of some latency and bandwidth due to the inter-chip communication.

{{< fig src="/images/t3-io-expander-at-top-level.png" caption="T3 input/output expansion" >}}

The use of the expansion chips did free up a significant portion of the pins needed for all the "fast" connections to reach the FPGA directly, these lines were the data lines from either the off-chip ADCs or T3.2 itself. Unfortunately the FPGA was still a few pins short, so multiplexers (MUX) were selected to allow the FPGA to switch between sets of signals to connect directly to itself to avoid the latency and bandwidth limitations inherent by the expander chip solution. 

The fact that there are essentially two sets of fast signals that are functionally mutually exclusive (off-chip ADCs vs. T3.2 readings) lends to easy multiplexing where the FPGA selects between one entire set of inputs or the other. The design I inherited from the previous student made use of this fact, it had a 48-channel 2:1 multiplexer circuit to accommodate multiplexing the 8 data lines for each of the six off-chip ADCs. 

{{< fig src="/images/t3-original-48-mux.png" caption="Original 48 signal MUX block (was composed of three parallel 16 signal MUX chips)" >}}

These 48 ADC signals were only being multiplexed with 12 signals from T3.2, so in reality only 12 signals needed to be multiplexed and the remaining 36 could be directly connected to the FPGA. This would reduce the size of the BoM in addition to removing the parasitic effects a multiplexer would impart on connections unnecessarily.

{{< fig src="/images/t3-12-mux.png" caption="Final 12 signal 2:1 multiplexer block" >}}

### Level Translation

T3.2's digital domain operates at 1.2&nbsp;V whereas the FPGA uses 3.3&nbsp;V signalling so level shifters were needed to translate these signals safely. In addition to the 3.3&nbsp;V&nbsp;to&nbsp;1.2&nbsp;V level shifters, there were a few that worked with 5&nbsp;V signals needed to operate some of the voltage reference circuitry and others for a handful of 5&nbsp;V signals from the FPGA to T3.2.

All these level shifters needed to operate at speeds of above 100&nbsp;MHz to operate effectively, so consideration was put into that when selecting the appropriate chips.

### Power Regulators

Eight voltage regulators are needed for T3.2 to be operational in the analog domain: five for the various power rails and three to act as voltage references for the ADCs. All these regulators for T3.2 can all have their output voltages adjusted using the digital potentiometers that form their feedback networks, in addition to being entirely enabled/disabled as desired via the FPGA. This allows for safe start-up procedures to be done automatically and the voltages to be adjust quickly and accurately as desired. These analog supply voltage regulators are all RTQ2520 chips, and are used as per their reference design with minor variations on the feedback topology used.

{{< fig src="/images/t3-vreg-circuit.png" caption="Design for the RTQ2520 chip used on the T3.2 board" >}}

These eight regulators are in addition to the six fixed regulators used to supply digital power to the components on the board. Separate 3.3&nbsp;V regulators for the FPGA, level shifters, and off-chip ADCs; 1.8&nbsp;V for the FPGA; and separate 1.2&nbsp;V regulators for the FPGA and T3.2.

These regulators were all selected based on those used previously for T3 or T7.

### Off-Chip Analog to Digital Convertors

The main change in the system design from T3 to T3.2's board is the introduction of these ADCs. Their purpose being to allow the group to read the analog signals generated by the pixels directly if the on-chip ones fail to meet performance requirements; allowing the pixels to still be used and evaluated on T3.2. 18 analog signals are fed out of T3.2 and must be sampled at rates exceeding 10&nbsp;MS/s for full utilization of T3.2, so six of the LM98722 Analog Front End chips were used which can sample 3 channels at rates of 15&nbsp;MS/s each.
