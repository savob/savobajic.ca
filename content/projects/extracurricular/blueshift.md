## Outcome

Unfortunately near the end of the project just weeks before the competition, the COVID-19 pandemic began so the team had to 
halt the construction of the bike as we lost access to our campus facilities. (I was able to continue work on this since I 
was using my own tools and ordering everything to my address anyways). This was soon followed by the cancellation of the 
event.

After a change of leadership in the team, it was decided that we would not invest the time and resources into competing in 
ASME's competitions for the near future to instead focus on our projects aimed at breaking records instead. **This meant 
that Blueshift was not going to be completed,** and thus my system would never get to be tested or used properly.

Even so, it served as an excellent design exercise and let me figure out some things to bring to TITAN, notably with layout.
