# Overview

The biggest project I undertook while working at Engineering Design Lab was leading the design of their in-house Vehicle Control Unit, VCU *- at least the electrical portion!* Based on an initial scope I established with Tomek (the founder) that was revised a bit over time, I set off and made a general purpose small vehicle controller for use in novel small electric vehicles.

## Requirements

## Takeaways

- PCBA services really save you headaches related to assembly related issues as well yield
- Marketing a product is hard

# Design

On paper it was a simple device to help novel electric vehicles come to market faster since in EDL's experience it was always the electronics that were a big unknown and also a bottleneck for clients developing novel electric mobility products.

# Iterations

# Enclosure

I mostly stuck to my lane and focused on electrical work, however I did help guide some of the design of the enclosure. Most of it was through the lens of electrical work, so indirectly influencing the design via connector choice, while other times accomodating mechanical requests like adding mounting holes.
