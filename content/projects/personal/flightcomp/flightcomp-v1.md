# Overview

My first design of a flight computer for my custom drone, based principally around and ATmega328P so it could be easily 
adapted to use open source efforts in drone control like ArduPilot which are based around common hobbyist chips like 
this one (from the Arduino Uno and Nano).



## Requirements

In addition to the general ones outlined for all flight computers

- Use the ATmega328P microcontroller as the heart of the system

## Takeaways

- Was a built in voltage regulator necessary?
