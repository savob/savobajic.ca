# Overview

The friends I was staying at when I was visiting Paris had recently acquired some second-hand self-balancing boards. The two 
boards work fine, however the six battery packs they got with them were all basically useless. I volunteered to replace the 
cells in them for my friends since they were no longer being produced and they didn't know how to do so themselves.

Learned some new techniques and successfully replaced the cells in two of the battery packs with new ones.

## Takeaways

- Working with batteries/cells needs extra condsiderations compared to circuit with no stored energy
- One **can** solder directly to cell terminals with the right process (acid)
- **Fully charge battery packs once assembled before first use!**

# Detailed Report

My friends I saw staying at in Paris had gotten some used self-balancing boards and battery packs a month or so before I 
arrived.

## Testing

After completing the first battery pack and letting it charge for a little we were excited to see the new batteries work. 
After the batteries charged for about a half hour, we decided to try the board out for a spin with them and they worked!

## Outcomes

I replaced the cells that made these two batteries and learned a few things along the way.

I've kept in touch with them since I've left but I'm not sure how much they're using the baords since winter arrived soon 
after I left.
