  <ul>
<li>Organized six hours of competitive activities designed to introduce students to their peers and to campus student clubs. These were attended by 18 groups of incoming students and leaders, totaling over 1100 participants.</li>
<li>Events were organized in collaboration with my co-chair and involved 70 volunteers. These volunteers were general event volunteers and representatives from approximately 20 external student clubs.</li>
<li>Planned and ran training sessions for volunteers to meet up and test event logistics, activity details and execution, and event transition planning. Feedback from training sessions was passed on to the volunteers and our overseeing officers along with overall progress updates.</li>
<li>Scheduled event timetable to maximize unique group pairings (so that students could meet more of their peers) and minimize the overall travel distance for all groups.</li>
<li>Executed event successfully with no delays or major issues due to detailed scheduling and extensive training. This was a significant improvement compared to the historical precedent where the events overran the scheduled time by over an hour.</li>
