    <h1>Frosh Prank</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">Organization: University of Toronto Engineering Orientation</div>
    <div class="subtitle">Term: May 2018 - Oct 2018</div>
    <div class="worksummary"> Organized an hour of entertainment for around 1000 attendees across 10 rooms with unique schedules for each one </div>
  </div>
     
  <div class="workcontent"><ul>
<li>Prepared an hour-long orientation seminar for the incoming class of roughly 1000 to attend as part of a comedic event that was initially billed as a serious seminar and was slowly revealed to be an entertaining show over the course of the hour.</li>
<li>Recruited a group of 18 volunteers in collaboration with co-chair and held regular training sessions to prepare volunteers to present prepared seminar material in separate lecture halls.</li>
<li>Recruited and managed a separate group of roughly 50 performance volunteers who were recruited as individuals or club representatives who were interested in participating in our event as “actors”. Their purpose was to perform skits during the seminars.</li>
<li>Planned events to take place in ten lecture halls in a single building, but faced sudden room booking cancellations by campus booking services a mere 5 days in advance and were forced to run event across rooms in two separate buildings. Reconfigured event schedules with co-chair to accommodate this and passed on the information to our volunteers and followed up to ensure that all relevant parties were aware of the change.</li>
<li>Reassigned work following unexplained absences of several volunteers to ensure the event would continue largely unchanged.</li>
</ul>
