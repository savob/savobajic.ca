<p>I expanded my force regulation system from just the single axis of feedback needed on the <a href="/projects/work/kneeload">kneeload robot<a/>
project from my previous term as a co-op student at IGB, to controlling up to six axes of force (three linear force, three torques)
so the company could perforn ingress-egress tests using a robotically manipulated mannequin.</p>
<p>In addition to being able to control these additional axes, I also improved the configurability of my tester, allowing the use of
specifically formatted text files to determine the forces needed at each pont of the test cycle. This made it easier for test
technicians to operate and customize the test protocol to each client&rsquo;s needs.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Regulate the force on six axes
<ul>
<li>Three linear forces (Fx, Fy, and Fz)</li>
<li>Three torques (Tx, Ty, and Tz)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implement this on the exsisting KUKA robots on site</li>
<li>Train test technicians to operate the completed system</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improve system documentation</li>
<li>Enable the use of configuration files for tests</li>
<li>Improve the communication speed between the robots and the computers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>This was by far the largest and most complicated LabVIEW project I had developed to date and exposed me to many concepts I had
not yet encountered in LabVIEW or coding in general. The concept that I spent most of my time on was the user input feature. It
required input verification to ensure that all the data was correct, as well as a way of handling invalid input and constructively
informing the user of their error and potential remedies. After implementing the data conditioning stage, I needed to rework the
internal logic of the program to operate using the configuration the user entered.</p>
<p>Modularizing the system&rsquo;s code enabled me to easily and rapidly scale it up from regulating just one to the six forces I needed.
I will continue to modularize my code based on function going forward, to help me if this happens in another project.</p>
<p>Although my communication protocol works as needed, using more purpose built hardware for data exchange would certainly increase
the bandwidth and thus decrease cycle times.</p>
<h1 id="detail">Detail</h1>
<p>This was the focus of my second time working at IGB Automotive. This project focused on implement force feedback routines into old
refurbished robotic arms to have them administer durability tests. This was built off some of the work I did the previous summer I
was there, implementing a much more basic system.</p>
<p>The robots had to follow paths that were defined by the clients, with set points that were expected to administer a desired force
on the seat, for example 500N downwards on the cushion, and repeat these cycles several thousand times. The problem with this is
that the robots had no internal force feedback/adjustment system; they were designed to merely go from point to point. This meant
that a robot going to a point may apply a force of 500N the first dozen times, however as the seat deforms from this cyclic loading
it may only apply 400N at the same position in a few hundred cycles.</p>
<p>Therefore, force feedback was vital to the system as it allowed technicians to properly configure the robots before starting the
test to meet these requirements and would allow the robots to self-correct their paths if force targets were not met mid-test.</p>
<p>There were two robots, each was equipped to administer a different type of test. One had a normal (single direction) load cell and
was meant for applying forces at distinct points on the automotive seat using a hemisphere endpiece (referred to as a ‘knee load’
test), the other was equipped with 6-axis load cell (X, Y, Z forces and torques) and an endpiece to simulate a torso as it moves in
and out of the seat (referred to as “Ingress/Egress” testing).</p>

<p>Other than their end-effectors, these robots were virtually identical. They were the same KUKA brand welding arm, used the same
control cabinet and computer system, and had a ‘companion’ computer running LabVIEW to monitor and record data from the tests using
the National Instruments data acquisition unit (DAQ). The reason for the companion computer collecting data instead of the robots’
own computer is due to the robots running a customized Windows 95 operating system with hardware from that era, making them
incompatible with modern equipment and software.</p>
<p>Reading into the documentation for the robots I found they had a programmable logic controller (PLC) interface that was still
supported, that I could use to feed the robot data directly from sensors (which I used for testing) before connecting it to the DAQ
to allow some basic communication between the robot and the companion computer. This led to the following system configuration for
both robots.</p>

<p>With the hardware selected (binary input/output modules for the PLCs) and configured, I began the process of making software to run
the system. This task was split into three parts: robot motion software, companion computer data processing, and communication
between robot and companion computer. In working on this I worked to minimize the effort required by technicians to reconfigure the
system for future tests.</p>

frame on the left, PLC is the bottom left, DAQ (and safety systems) are in-between the displays, the companion computer is on the right.

<p>The robot motion software was written on the robot control computer using KUKA Robotics Language (KRL), I learned and tested different
command to achieve the ability to not only adjust the points mid-test (regulating load) but to also make it easy to configure the
robots to new paths but only needing users to enter in the new points.</p>
<p>Data processing did not require much reworking to get it working at a basic level, the company already had some LabVIEW programs to
monitor and record the force, I only added checks to see if the robot was meeting the required loading criteria to get a basic
feedback system working. However, the test parameters were historically hardcoded into the software which meant a different application
had to be compiled for each different test. I spent a significant portion of my time rewriting the code so it could load in the test
parameters using external configuration files made in Excel which made the system much more accessible to the technicians to configure.</p>
<p>The communication required work on both halves of the system (robot and companion computer). To transmit data between the two I used a
parallel communication system using the binary inputs and outputs on each half of the system. The reason for a parallel configuration
was to maximize the bandwidth because the hardware used (DAQ and PLC) was not designed for rapid switch timings, this also helped keep
the systems synchronized.</p>
<p>The result of these was a system where the user would place a seat for testing, turn on both systems, select the appropriate motion
program on the robot, select the appropriate configuration on the companion computer and run the test. Once the first few cycles were
completed without issue the technician could leave the robot to perform the remainder unsupervised.</p>
<p>Throughout this project I was tasked with documenting my work and writing technical documentation for other to refer to in my absence.
This included basic step-by-step instruction on how to perform basic operations with the robot and troubleshooting to advanced
programming with examples.</p>
