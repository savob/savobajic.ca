  <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>I have for a while wanted to take a break from microcontroller-based projects and try
my hand at doing a project without one. Without completely surrendering myself to the
world of analog, I took a stop towards this by try to do the classic hobbyist project
of a clock, but only with discrete logic chips.</p>
<p>The idea came to me when browsing through a cache of old electronics a friend of mine had
come into and a friend mentioned they wanted to learn to make a clock with a microcontroller
so I decided to make one of my own too.</p>
<p>Currently I have tested all the modules on breadboards and transferred them to KiCAD
so I could layout PCBs. <strong>Currently waiting to have them made.</strong></p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Show the time in some format</li>
<li>Be modular by function</li>
<li>No microcontrollers allowed!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Be accurate to within two seconds a day</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m a bit rusty at breadboard prototyping, need to double check my connections are actually
working as they appear they should with continuity tests.</li>
<li>Discrete logic isn&rsquo;t as troublesome as I expected, but this also is a basic project really.
I would look to maybe use some in future projects, especially for safety systems and such.</li>
<li><em>Does h4x0r aesthetic == poor user experience?</em></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="detailed-report">Detailed Report</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to do something without a microcontroller for a while now since that&rsquo;s been the
common denominator in basically any project of moderate scale I&rsquo;ve undertaken thus far. During
a visit back home I was invited by friend to check out a cache of second-hand electronic
components he had purchased to see if there was anything that tickled my fancy.</p>
<p>These were a collection of organizers chock-full of goodies, from bulky switches and
potentiometers down to individual passives clearly pried from some long forgotten control
cabinet. Among these dozen or so cabinets were a few stuffed with logic ICs from all the
standard families: 7400-, 4000-, or 4500-series classic.</p>
<p>Initially I was just grabbing ones that looked cool to <em>potentially</em> use in some future project.
However my other friend mentioned they wanted to make a clock so I took their idea and ran
with it, grabbing ICs I felt would be useful for the job and a fistful of LED displays.</p>
<p>I quickly realized that this circuit was going to have to be large to fit all the ICs,
especially since they all came in DIP14/16 packaging. So I felt that a modular design would
be wise to keep things (and issues) separate. It would also help create a sort of clich√©
&ldquo;80&rsquo;s hacker&rdquo; aesthetic when paired with all through hole components and floating jumpers.</p>
<h2 id="module-design-and-prototyping">Module Design and Prototyping</h2>
<p>I broke the system into modules based on function:</p>
<ul>
<li>Displays and counters. Two digits per panel</li>
<li>Reset (rollover, carry) logic for each digit</li>
<li>Base clock signal and power delivery</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chip-choice">Chip Choice</h3>
<p>Limiting myself to the chips available in the cache, I selected the following chips for
the different modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display drivers (they share functionality pin-for-pin for easy switching as needed)
<ul>
<li>74LS47 for common anode displays</li>
<li>CD4511 for common cathode displays</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Counters
<ul>
<li>74LS193 programmable 4-bit counters</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reset logic
<ul>
<li>74LS32 quad OR gate</li>
<li>74LS08 quad AND gate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clock divider (for 32.768 kHz crystal to 1Hz base)
<ul>
<li>CD4060</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="displays">Displays</h3>
<p>The first part I worked on prototyping and getting working was the displays since they
would be used to debug the rest of the circuit. Once I had sorted the displays based on
whether they were common anode or cathode, I began to connect them to the drivers
and would cycle through values to display using a set of switches to ensure I had
everything connected properly. This worked without a hitch.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h3 id="counters">Counters</h3>
<p>A clock is basically one large counter composed of individual counters for each digit.
The ones on the seconds count to 10, then reset and increment the next digit, up to 6.
At that point the minutes increment up, so on and so forth. Thus each digit needs its
own counter in addition to a driver. These counters would count the leading edges of
an input wave and output their value on four pins.</p>
<h3 id="reset-logic">Reset Logic</h3>
<p>The counters I used (74LS193) are true 4-bit counters so they rollover and reset at 16,
so all digits need external logic to properly reset the counters and increment the next
digit. To achieve this I am using some AND and OR gates to check the output of the counters
and then use the result of this logic to reset and increment counters.</p>
<p>For example, if we want to rollover a digit at 10, we can use a single AND gate to
see if the 8 and 2 bits are both set and then use it to reset the counter. This works
because under normal operation the numbers increment upwards from 0 so there is no
chance for the clock to overshoot and miss the reset. However if the user inputs a
value over the set point, i.e. 11, then depending on the logic used, the system
might not recent properly. I believe this is an acceptable error case because it
will correct itself once the digit is reset, although it will through off the time
in the process.</p>
<p>Below is a demonstration of a counter set up as described to count to 10 using the
external AND gate.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>To ensure the pulse generated to reset a counter is long enough to also increment the
adjacent counter I performed tests on cascaded timers that were successful.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h3 id="signal-generator">Signal Generator</h3>
<p>The heartbeat of the clock is a steady, accurate 1Hz square wave. This square wave is
generated using the same system used in most digital watches and real-time clocks (RTCs),
dividing a 32 768 Hz signal down to 1 Hz. This is done by using a chain of T flip-flops
that each half the frequency fed into them. 15 of these are needed to divide the 32 768
Hz (2^15) down to 1 Hz.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/images/clock-division.jpg">
<figcaption>Division of the reference 32 768 Hz wave (blue) by a factor of 16 to generate the output (yellow)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The CD4060 was designed for this job, having a string of T flip flops needed to divide the
signal, as well as the circuitry needed to drive the reference crystal used to provide
the 32 768 Hz. The only issue is that it has only 14 flip flops internally, so two CD4060s
are needed to divide the signal all the way down to 1 Hz.</p>
<h4 id="prototyping-issues">Prototyping Issues</h4>
<p>Making the prototype module for the clock on a breadboard was where I lost most of my time.
I was using a reference design I found and the system would work fine, however if I left it
running for a few minutes it would start to shift its frequency higher until it would
eventually just stop working entirely. This is not something I wanted. I wanted to make a
<em>&ldquo;clock&rdquo;</em> clock, not an egg timer.</p>
<p>So I spent a few days trying to tune and dial in the values of the passives around the
crystal, changing the crystal, even the CD4060 with brand new ones to see what I could
do to improve the stability. The best I got was just about 3 minutes before failure.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/images/clock-crystal-trials.jpg">
<figcaption>Results of my trials of different passives around my crystal</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the end what turned out to be the cause of my issues is that the CD4060 did not have
its reset pin properly grounded so it collected a charge during operation and resulted
in these intermittent resets of the chip. This was caused by a break internal to the
jumper I was using to ground it, inside the plastic head at one end.</p>
<h2 id="circuit-boards">Circuit Boards</h2>
<p>Once I had established the circuit for each module tested and documented, I transferred
the schematics to KiCAD and laid out a circuit board for each module.</p>
<p>I used edge connectors to pass the signals between them since it will also provide more
structural stiffness compared to jumpers when hung up on a wall.</p>
<p>For the display I added the ability for the user to set the digits using jumpers to set
a value, and then pressing a button to load it into the desired counter. Originally
I intended to use a more conventional and user-friendly button to increment counters but
the issue of debouncing and combining clock signals would have needed me to add much
more to the boards. On the plus side, I think the exposed headers will add to the &ldquo;hacker&rdquo;
aesthetic.</p>

<p>The reset module is little more than a breakout for the two available logic ICs. Since each
digit set may need different conditions to reset, it will be up to me to wire the logic on
each board myself as need when I assemble them.</p>

<p>The only addition to the signal generator board was the power input to supply the power rails.</p>

<h2 id="assembly">Assembly</h2>
<p>I have all of the components ready to go.</p>
<p>I am currently waiting for a few other projects to be designed before committing to one
massive PCB order which this will be part of.</p>
