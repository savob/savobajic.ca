  <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>I wanted to make something small and simple (<em>read: cheap</em>) to hand out to friends and family for the holidays, and I felt
that a small blinking ornament would be perfect for this. LEDs and resistors are cheap and hardy, batteries and a basic
control system would be manageable.</p>
<p>In the end the circuit was nothing more than a basic 555 timer based blinker running off a 9V battery. I ordered panelized
boards to have plenty to hand out and hand soldered them all.</p>
<p>The reception was good all round, so I might redo these again!</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have blinking lights</li>
<li>Not cost more than $5 a unit</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cost less than $3 a unit</li>
<li>LEDs to be visible in daylight</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Trinkets are good way to show off to non-technical people in your life.</li>
<li>9V batteries are convenient power sources, but bulky, heavy, and unsightly really - which is not desirable for hanging in a tree.</li>
<li>Bright lights are good, but batteries have a finite amount of energy so I should have made them dimmer.
<ul>
<li>Batteries only lasted about two days.</li>
<li>Could have string LEDs in series to use the same current.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Practised hand soldering surface mount parts</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="detailed-report">Detailed Report</h1>
<p>Since I had picked up electronics as a hobby, about two and a half years before I started this project I had difficulties
trying to show and impress my mom and some of my non-technical friends with my projects since other than the <a href="../gameboi/">gameBOI</a>
I had nothing that could operate on its own, like the stuff I did for HPVDT all needed the vehicles to gather the data from.
Even the gameBOI was a bit daunting since it wasn&rsquo;t intuitive how to operate it.</p>
<p>I also wanted to make a present for a bunch of my friends so I had the idea to kill two birds with one stone and make a nice
electronic ornament for people. It would be simple and cheap, but its purpose was clear so you didn&rsquo;t need to explain what
it did or how to operate it when giving it out.</p>
<h2 id="circuit-design">Circuit Design</h2>
<p>I wanted to have a dozen LEDs on the ornament, with half always on and the other half blinking away at some slow frequency.
I wanted to use the common &ldquo;gum drop&rdquo; through hole type of LEDs common with DIY kits since I believed they would look nicer
and cozier than some SMT ones. I also decided that a 9V battery would be used for the power since it was a common battery
that supplied a decent voltage in a single unit.</p>
<p>All that remained to design was the blinking system, so I turned to everyone&rsquo;s favourite IC, the old reliable 555 set to run
in astable (free-running, oscillating) mode. Not only was the 555 timer a good choice for keeping the circuit simple and
reliable, it also was able to drive the &ldquo;high&rdquo; power output directly so no additional transistors were needed. Thus the
component count would be kept low.</p>

</figure>
<p>My choice of passives resulted in the blinking lights being on for about 1.8 seconds, and off for 1.4, which I felt was just
the right rate to not be too attention grabbing nor too &ldquo;slow&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>
<p>Layout was pretty basic, I put the 555 in the middle with its components and then arranged the LEDs around the perimeter of
the circle. This was the first time that I used part orientations on a circuit board other than some multiple of 90°, since
I was putting the LEDs in increments of 30°.</p>
<p>To make the ornament function as a better ornament, I put a circle of silkscreen in the middle so I could write messages to
people on them and also added two small holes at the top to put a string through to hang it up. The final size ended up
being 45mm in diameter.</p>

<p>The top of the board is where most of the traces were made and all components were placed. I had the 555 sit in the middle
so a ground pour could reach all around for the LEDs.</p>

<p>I kept the bottom bare of components so that I could easily leave a message in the middle on the silkscreen circle. Although
&ldquo;placed&rdquo; on the other side I was actually going to solder the LEDs to face out this side.</p>

<h2 id="panelization">Panelization</h2>
<p>I did not do this myself. I ordered the PCBs to be panelized by the manufacturer, JLCPCB. I did this so I could get many
more boards at basically the same price since the ornaments were 45mm in diameter and any board up to 100mm by 100mm costs
the same.</p>
<h2 id="assembly">Assembly</h2>
<p>The boards arrived panelized as I wanted, with four boards per panel. I ordered five panels each in red and green, so I had
enough boards to make 40 ornaments., far more than I actually planned to.</p>

<p>I did not order a stencil to administer solder paste for this board, since I figured I could hand solder all the components
because even the 555 had a decent pitch (spacing) of pins that it wouldn&rsquo;t be hard. When came to actually hand soldering all
the parts on it wasn&rsquo;t to difficult with tweezers and my iron. I soldered the 555s using &ldquo;track&rdquo; or &ldquo;drag&rdquo; soldering where I
flooded solder across all the pins and then removed the excess with solder braid/wick.</p>

<h2 id="testing-and-555-issue">Testing and 555 Issue</h2>
<p>After assembling my first one I tried to power it on and have it blink. Unfortunately it didn&rsquo;t, the LEDs the 555 controlled
never lit up. I tried to make a second, but this time the LEDs the 555 controlled we held perpetually high. So I started to
investigate what I was doing wrong.</p>
<p>My first suspicion was that I was <strong>over heating the 555s</strong> when I was soldering them, since I was running my iron at 350°C
(~660°F) to melt my lead-free solder and applying heat for a long period time to drag solder its leads. To see if this was
true I made a ornament using leaded solder and running my soldering iron at a lower temperature of 300°C (~570°F). This
did the trick, and I was able to assemble the rest of my boards without issue like this.</p>
<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>Once they were assembled using a lower temperature to solder the 555s, they all worked and I prepared string loops for each
and handed them out to my friends and family.</p>
