  <section class="mainContent">
  <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>I need a new revision of my ESC to accommodate the replacement MOSFET drivers I was able to source. I will also use this as
an opportunity to fix some of the minor inconveniences I face with V4.</p>
<p>Currently still finalizing the board and hope to order it in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>None so far, project is still to be designed, let alone tested.</p>
<h1 id="detailed-report">Detailed Report</h1>
<p>This revision was started because I had run out of functioning parts during the testing of V4 and the IC shortage has forced
me to select an alternative MOSFET driver, the <a href="https://www.mouser.ca/datasheet/2/196/Infineon-IRS2334-DataSheet-v01_00-EN-1228568.pdf">IRS2334S</a>
from International Rectifier as the replacement for the FAN7388s and FAN7888s I was using until then.</p>
<p>My goal is to keep the board as similar to V4 so that my code doesn&rsquo;t have to be significantly altered and I can focus on
getting the motors to work.</p>
<h2 id="circuit-design">Circuit Design</h2>
<p>Circuit design is basically the same as <a href="../esc-v4/#circuit-design">V4</a> with only a few minor changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Replaced the FAN7388/FAN7888 MOSFET driver with the IRS2334S</li>
<li>Removed the unnecessary resistor on the UDPI line (R2 in V4&rsquo;s schematic)</li>
<li>Rearranged the MOSFET driver signals such that all the low side signals are on one port. (Done to simplify/optimize coding for commutations)</li>
<li>Added a status LED on the last unused pin</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>
<p>Laying out the board I wanted to try and keep the part placements identical to V4&rsquo;s so I could reuse the same solder paste
stencil, this is a major reason why I choose the IRS2334S since it came in the same package as the FAN7x88s. Other than the
addition of the status LED, I was able to leave all components in their place and seat the new ones in place of removed ones
(R2 where old R2 was, and the MOSFET drivers).</p>
<p>Routing traces was a bit harder than expected since I didn&rsquo;t want to redo the entire thing from scratch. As a result, I
spent a good portion of my routing seeing how close I could squeeze some traces and vias.</p>

<p>The top side of the board houses the MOSFET driver circuitry on the left half and the feedback network on the right.</p>

<p>The bottom of the board is where the control section and MOSFETs are located. I added the status diode between the address
pads and R2 on the left.</p>

<h2 id="assembly">Assembly</h2>
<p>I have already ordered and recieved the components I need for this project. All that I need to do is order the boards and
to get to it.</p>
<h2 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h2>
<p>Nothing really yet.</p>
