  <p><em>Small note: the actual title of this position was &ldquo;Advance Co-op&rdquo; since I worked for the &ldquo;Advance&rdquo; department which was responsible to &ldquo;advance&rdquo; our technologies. However, I have listed it as &ldquo;Advance<strong>d</strong>&rdquo; since everyone seems to think of it as a spelling mistake at first glance.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Integrated a force regulation system into legacy robotic arm systems for use in seat durability testing.
This system was an expanded version of my previous work going from regulating a single axis of force to six, so a controlled path can be followed adapting to regulate force and torque at each point.</li>
<li>A PLC to computer interface was created using a National Instruments data acquisition unit that was operated using a LabVIEW program on the computer.</li>
<li>Emulated a serial communication protocol between the robot PLC and computer using software to communicate status and instructions to and from the robot.</li>
<li>Trained technicians to operate and configure the durability testing system, allowing tests to be tailored to the needs of specific clients.</li>
<li>Prepared technical documents detailing system operation catered to different levels of users for the system.</li>
<li>Contributed code to improve the flexibility of our end of line product testers so they could be easily reconfigured for new clients and products.</li>
