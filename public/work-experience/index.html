	<p class="subtitle">Advanced Micro and Nanosystems Lab, University of Toronto</p>
	<p class="subtitle">May 2021 - September 2021</p>





<p class="listEntry">Contributed electro-magneto-thermal simulations and hardware design for novel hyperthermia therapy for globioblastoma.</p>


		
		
			<ul>
			
				<li>Designed and assembled a 3D magnetic field generator for testing novel Glioblastoma therapies using alternating magnetic fields generated from four pairs of magnetic tweezers.</li>
			
				<li>Conducted literature review on magneto-thermal relationships of iron nano-particles to guide in design decision making.</li>
			
				<li>Created multiple models in COMSOL Multi-Physics to predict electro-magneto-thermo-relationships used to forecast efficacy of treatments and sensitivity of the system.</li>
			
				<li>Improved magnetic field generator design to increase survey-able workspace by 50%</li>

	<p class="subtitle">Patheon, a part of ThermoFisher Scientific</p>
	<p class="subtitle">July 2019 - August 2020</p>





<p class="listEntry">Worked to oversee and implement new preventative and predictive maintenance programs, as well as providing other support to the engineering team</p>


		
		
			<ul>
			
				<li>Aided in the introduction of new equipment to the site by researching maintenance requirements and establishing formal and traceable preventative maintenance work plans and schedules</li>
			
				<li>Prepared weekly Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as unexpected downtime, number of work orders, and duration of repairs based on equipment performance for each department</li>
			
				<li>Prepared monthly KPIs including summaries of the weekly KPIs and KPIs that categorized all the equipment failures for the month. Used KPIs to submit recommendations to maintenance that decreased annual downtime by more than 20%</li>
			
				<li>Mediated inter-department disputes that arose during project delivery</li>
			
				<li>Expanded and maintained vibrational analysis predictive maintenance (PdM) program for critical assets. This led to detection and correction of five instances of early failure signs in the first three months of deployment</li>

	<p class="subtitle">IGB Automotive</p>
	<p class="subtitle">May 2018 - August 2018</p>





<p class="listEntry">Focused on developing novel quality assurance testing schemes for an automotive component supplier.</p>


		
		
			<ul>
			
				<li>Integrated a force regulation system into legacy robotic arm systems for use in seat durability testing. This system was an expanded version of my previous work going from regulating a single axis of force to six, so a controlled path can be followed adapting to regulate force and torque at each point.</li>
			
				<li>A PLC to computer interface was created using a National Instruments data acquisition unit that was operated using a LabVIEW program on the computer.</li>
			
				<li>Emulated a serial communication protocol between the robot PLC and computer using software to communicate status and instructions to and from the robot.</li>
			
				<li>Trained technicians to operate and configure the durability testing system, allowing tests to be tailored to the needs of specific clients.</li>
			
				<li>Prepared technical documents detailing system operation catered to different levels of users for the system.</li>
			
				<li>Contributed code to improve the flexibility of our end of line product testers so they could be easily reconfigured for new clients and products.</li>
			
			</ul>

	<p class="subtitle">IGB Automotive</p>
	<p class="subtitle">May 2017 - August 2017</p>





<p class="listEntry">Was introduced to, and developed automated durability testing for automotive parts.</p>


		
		
			<ul>
			
				<li>Developed and performed different material tests to determine key performance indicators to assist in design decisions such as resistance to bending fatigue, and compiled reports based on the results</li>
			
				<li>Interfaced a legacy (1995) welding robotics system to be controlled by modern computers. System conducted durability testing on automotive seats by repeatedly applying controlled linear forces to predefined points</li>
			
				<li>Programmed system in LabVIEW to operate the robot, calibrate the load cell, control the seat features remotely, and record testing data</li>
			
				<li>Conducted troubleshooting and corrective maintenance on manufacturing equipment for mechanical/electrical issues to prevent extended production interruptions</li>
			
				<li>Developed the hardware and software for a new product showcase system at industry showcases</li>
